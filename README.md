# Welcome to my Mini data analysis! This is a project assigned by STAT 545A, where I have been assigned to complete a small data analysis based on a data set of our choosing. 

# You will find the following documents in this repository: 
1. SaintMDA1.Rmd: The Rstudio markdown file containing the code I used to carry out the first part of the data analysis
2. SaintMDA1.html: The RStudio markdown file, renderred to an html file. Please download this file and open this *html version it in a webpage to see the output of the R code.
